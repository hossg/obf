This is a sample file that holds some secrets. For example, both Bob and Sue are examples of a secret name.
Similarly you'd expect that their email addresses bob@bobandsue.com and sue@bobandsue.com should be considered secrets.
This line just confims behaviour with preceding or following punctuation, and EOL behaviour. "Bob", "Sue". Bob's house. Sue
Bob Sue.

This line has another email address in it: alpha.beta@google.com that ought to be obfuscated.
